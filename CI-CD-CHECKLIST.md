# CI/CD Pipeline Implementation Checklist

## Phase 1: Initial Setup ‚öôÔ∏è

### GitHub Repository Setup
- [ ] Create GitHub repository (if not exists)
- [ ] Initialize git in project directory
- [ ] Add `.gitignore` file
- [ ] Commit and push initial code
- [ ] Create `develop` branch

### GitHub Secrets Configuration
- [ ] Create Docker Hub account (if needed)
- [ ] Generate Docker Hub access token
- [ ] Add `DOCKER_USERNAME` secret to GitHub
- [ ] Add `DOCKER_PASSWORD` secret to GitHub
- [ ] Verify secrets are accessible

### Pipeline Files
- [ ] Copy `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml` to repository root
- [ ] Review and customize workflow configuration
- [ ] Commit workflow file to repository
- [ ] Verify workflow appears in Actions tab

## Phase 2: Testing & Validation üß™

### Local Validation
- [ ] Test backend build locally
  ```powershell
  cd task1-java-backend
  # Verify pom.xml and source code
  ```
- [ ] Test frontend build locally
  ```powershell
  cd task3-react-frontend
  npm install
  npm run build
  ```
- [ ] Test Docker build locally
  ```powershell
  docker build -t task-manager:test -f task2-kubernetes/Dockerfile .
  ```

### Pipeline Testing
- [ ] Push code to `develop` branch
- [ ] Monitor pipeline execution in Actions tab
- [ ] Verify `build-and-test-backend` job succeeds
- [ ] Verify `build-frontend` job succeeds
- [ ] Verify `security-scan` job completes
- [ ] Check `docker-build-and-push` job (if on main/develop)
- [ ] Review any errors or warnings

### Security Scan
- [ ] Navigate to Security ‚Üí Code scanning alerts
- [ ] Review Trivy scan results
- [ ] Address critical vulnerabilities
- [ ] Document accepted risks

## Phase 3: Docker Integration üê≥

### Docker Hub Setup
- [ ] Verify image pushed to Docker Hub
- [ ] Check image tags (latest, sha, branch)
- [ ] Test pulling image locally
  ```powershell
  docker pull YOUR-USERNAME/task-manager:latest
  ```
- [ ] Verify image runs correctly
  ```powershell
  docker run -p 8080:8080 YOUR-USERNAME/task-manager:latest
  ```

### Kubernetes Integration
- [ ] Update `app-deployment.yaml` with Docker Hub image
  ```yaml
  image: YOUR-USERNAME/task-manager:latest
  imagePullPolicy: Always
  ```
- [ ] Apply updated deployment
  ```powershell
  kubectl apply -f task2-kubernetes/app-deployment.yaml
  ```
- [ ] Verify pod uses CI-built image
  ```powershell
  kubectl describe pod -l app=task-manager | Select-String "Image:"
  ```
- [ ] Test application functionality

## Phase 4: Deployment Automation üöÄ

### Environment Setup
- [ ] Configure GitHub Environments
  - [ ] Create `development` environment
  - [ ] Create `production` environment
  - [ ] Add environment protection rules
- [ ] Add deployment scripts to workflow
- [ ] Test deployment to development
- [ ] Test deployment to production

### Deployment Verification
- [ ] Verify automatic deployment on develop push
- [ ] Verify automatic deployment on main push
- [ ] Check deployment logs
- [ ] Verify application health after deployment
- [ ] Test rollback procedure

## Phase 5: Branch Strategy üåø

### Branch Protection
- [ ] Enable branch protection for `main`
  - [ ] Require pull request reviews
  - [ ] Require status checks to pass
  - [ ] Require signed commits (optional)
- [ ] Enable branch protection for `develop`
- [ ] Configure CODEOWNERS file (optional)

### Workflow Integration
- [ ] Test PR workflow (feature ‚Üí develop)
- [ ] Verify CI runs on PR
- [ ] Test merge to develop triggers deployment
- [ ] Test merge to main triggers production deployment

## Phase 6: Monitoring & Notifications üìä

### Pipeline Monitoring
- [ ] Set up GitHub Actions usage monitoring
- [ ] Review pipeline execution times
- [ ] Identify and optimize slow jobs
- [ ] Set up failure notifications

### Application Monitoring
- [ ] Add health check endpoints
- [ ] Set up application monitoring (optional)
- [ ] Configure log aggregation (optional)
- [ ] Set up alerts for failures

### Notifications (Optional)
- [ ] Set up Slack webhook
- [ ] Add Slack notification to workflow
- [ ] Test success notifications
- [ ] Test failure notifications
- [ ] Configure email notifications

## Phase 7: Documentation üìö

### Code Documentation
- [ ] Update README.md with CI/CD badge
- [ ] Document pipeline workflow
- [ ] Add deployment instructions
- [ ] Document rollback procedures

### Team Onboarding
- [ ] Share CI/CD setup guide
- [ ] Train team on workflow usage
- [ ] Document common issues and solutions
- [ ] Create runbook for deployment

## Phase 8: Optimization & Enhancement üîß

### Performance
- [ ] Enable build caching
- [ ] Optimize Docker layers
- [ ] Parallelize independent jobs
- [ ] Review and reduce build times

### Additional Features
- [ ] Add automated database migrations
- [ ] Add performance testing
- [ ] Add integration tests
- [ ] Add code coverage reporting
- [ ] Add automated changelog generation

### Security Enhancements
- [ ] Enable Dependabot
- [ ] Set up code scanning (CodeQL)
- [ ] Add secret scanning
- [ ] Configure security policies

## Phase 9: Production Readiness ‚úÖ
